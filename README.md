# bamazon

Bamazon is a CLI application that allows a user to search through a MySQL product database, select products they would like to purchase, and make mock purchases.

Some ways I plan on improving this application are to add a front end, and a manager level that will allow someone to check inventory, as well as add new inventory and new products
